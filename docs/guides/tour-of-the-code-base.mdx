# Tour of the Code Base
This document will outline the general structure of the code, the standards, and norms employed for the library.

## Developer CLI Tasks
* `yarn bootstrap` run after adding new internal dependencies to a package
* `yarn lint`
* `yarn test` will run all tests via [Cypress](https://cypress.io)
* `yarn cypress open` will open tests in [Cypress](https://cypress.io) for local development
* `yarn lerna add --scope @andrew-codes/verdigris-package-name dependency-to-add` (see below for details on managing dependencies)

## Managing Dependencies
Packages are managed using [lerna](https://lernajs.io/). Each package has its own list of dependencies. Therefore, dependencies are not added at the project root level; rather scoped to a specific package. There are `yarn` scripts to help automate this:

> **Note**: If you run into trouble after installing a new dependency, try running `yarn && yarn bootstrap`.

* **Adding** a new dependency, use `yarn lerna add --scope @andrew-codes/verdigris-package-name dependency-name`
* For **dev dependencies**, add the `--dev` CLI option `yarn lerna add --dev --scope @andrew-codes/verdigris-package-name dependency-name`
* **Removing** dependencies requires deleting the item from the package's `package.json` and re-running `yarn bootstrap` in the project root.

## Structure
This code base is a mono-repo and leverages [lerna](https://lernajs.io/) to manage dependencies. There are a few top-level concerns that will be detailed:

* **`build`**: contains a collection of private, un-publishable packages related to the configuration or build process in general. This includes things docz customizations, SVG file to component webpack loader, etc.
* **`docs`**: collection of MDX files, such as this one, which contain relevant documentation on the repo itself.
* **`components`**: directory of component packages; most of which will be publishable. See below for more details.
* **`cypress`**: directory of e2e tests run via [Cypress](https://cypress.io).
* **`packages`**: directory of non-component packages; most of which will be publishable.
* **`scripts`**: miscellaneous utility scripts, such ads a shell script for creating a new component package.

### Anatomy of a Component Package
Component packages all follow the same directory structure and general guidelines:

* The package name (directory) is camel case
* `package.json` contains a `verdigris` key with the value containing metadata about the component
* `src` directory contains all source files
* `package.json` contains a `main` key that points to the distribution index file (`dist/index.js`)
* `package.json` contains a `verdigris:src` file pointing to the source index file (`src/index.js`)
* `docs` directory houses documentation about package (MDX files)

> **Note**: `verdigris:src` value is used to resolve the package to the source index file during development time. During development, there is no `dist/*.js` files and we do not want to have to build every component to be able to import them into another component's package.

#### Component Package Directory Structure
```bash
.
└── componentName
    ├── docs
    │  ├── component-1.mdx
    │  └── component-2.mdx
    ├── src
    │  ├── index.js
    │  ├── Component1.js
    │  ├── Component2.js
    │  └── otherSupportingFile.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md
```

## Tests
Tests are run via [Cypress](https://cypress.io) and are located in `cypress/integration`. Tests are run against a running local instance of the site. `yarn test` will start the site for the tests. However, in order to run tests interactively for development, first run `yarn start` to start the site, then `yarn cypress open` to open the [Cypress](https://cypress.io) test runner.

Tests should be written against the examples page of components on the docs site. This ensures that the docs' examples are fully complete; while giving a test bed for running e2e tests on the components in isolation.

## Updating Site Content
Content in Verdigris is written using a flavor [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) that enables rendering React componenets called [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). **MDX files may be located anywhere within the project and will be included in the docs site**. Use the frontmatter of the doc file to control its location in the menu, page title, and route:

```md
---
name: Component Name
route: /packages/componentPackageName/components/ComponentName
order: 100
menu: 3. Components
---
```

> **Notes**:
>
> 1. order is descending (larger numbers appear closer to top of the stack; much like z-index)
> 2. Use `../` instead of `./` when linking to internal pages

### Component Documentation Pages
Component documnetation pages should follow the route pattern: `/packages/componentPackageName/components/ComponentName`.

#### Adding Images to Component Documentation Pages
Images are imported into MDX like any other JavaScript resource. The imported value may then be used as the `src` attribute of an `<img />` element. As an example:

```mdx
import myPic from './my-pic.png'

<img src={myPic} alt="Best pic evar!" />
```

> **Notes**:
> Remember to keep imports at the top of the MDX file, after the frontmatter, and without extra new lines between them.

### Adding New Pages
**MDX files may be located anywhere within the project and will be included in the docs site**
