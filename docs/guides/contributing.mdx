2.  Clone your forked repository
3.  `cd verdigris` to change directory into root of project
4.  `yarn && yarn bootstrap` to install and bootstrap dependencies

### Running Site Locally

1.  Open the terminal and change into project's root directory; `cd verdigris`
2.  Run `yarn start` in the terminal
3.  Open Chrome and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### PR Deployment Preview Sites

In addition to running lint and tests for all open PRs via Travis, every PR will deploy a preview site. See the PR in GitHub for a link to the PR's deployed sample site.

## Commit Guidelines

We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted. This leads to more readable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history. But also, we use the git commit messages to generate the change log.

### Commit Message Format

Each commit message consists of a header, a body and a footer. The header has a special format that includes a type, a scope and a subject:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

> **Notes**: The header is mandatory and the scope of the header is optional.

### Revert

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert:`, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>`., where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted. A commit with this format is automatically created by the git revert command.

### Type

Must be one of the following:

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

### Scope

The scope could be anything specifying the place of the commit change and is optional.

You can use `*` when the change affects more than a single scope.

### Subject

The subject contain succinct description of the change:

- use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- don't capitalize first letter
- no dot '.' at the end

### Body

Just as in the subject, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes". The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

### Footer

The footer should contain any information about Breaking Changes and is also the place to reference issues that this commit closes.

> **Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE`: with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.
